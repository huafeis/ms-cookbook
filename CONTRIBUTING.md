# Contributing to ModelScope Cookbook

Thank you for contributing practical, reproducible knowledge to the cookbook.

## Report an issue

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-cookbook/issues/new) with the affected chapter or page, expected behavior, actual behavior, and reproduction steps. For layout issues, include browser, viewport size, and a screenshot without private data.

## Submit a pull request

1. Discuss substantial changes in an issue before implementation.
2. Fork the repository and create a focused branch.
3. Edit chapter sources in `content/chapters/` or website files in `index.html` and `assets/`.
4. Preserve article wording, heading hierarchy, section order, code, formulas, and media. Content corrections need a clear source or author approval. Keep layout fixes separate from editorial changes.
5. After editing chapter sources, run `python3 scripts/build-content.py`, then `node scripts/check-site.mjs`. Preview the affected pages on desktop and mobile.
6. Submit a pull request with a concise summary, validation results, and asset attribution. Commit regenerated `assets/content.js` with its source changes.

Never include credentials, document passwords, access tokens, private data, or materials you do not have permission to distribute. Preserve third-party licenses and notices.

Maintain the two community QR images in `assets/community/qr.png` and `assets/community/agentwork-qr.png`. Preserve their scan quality and verify both desktop and mobile presentation after replacement.

The website's **社区共建** page provides the community QR code, submission routes, and verified code contributor links. Author and reviewer credits are added after names and roles are confirmed.

AIGC contribution directions include image and brand LoRA, image editing, video consistency and workflows, audio and music generation, and evaluation. These are open contribution directions; availability of completed chapters is shown in the book index.
